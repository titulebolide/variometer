# [WIP] Variometer
This is not the final name, nor a good representation of what the projet aims to be.
But for the moment it is an attempt at tuning an android phone into a variometer.

## How?
By trying to come up with kalman filter models made specifically to mitigate the issue seen with phone : a delay between atmospheric pressure and its readings.

## Test folder
Here are tested the different kalman models to be implemented

## Src folder
Here is implemented with react-native the kalman filter tested beforehand.
